# My Login Page

Hey there! 👋  
This is my **Login Page** made using **HTML and CSS**.  
It’s simple, colorful, and has a nice background image.  
I made it as part of my web design practice! 😄

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Download or copy both files — `index.html` and `style.css`.  
2. Make sure both are in the same folder.  
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.  
4. That’s it! You’ll see the login page. 🎉
